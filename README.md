# astroJavaApp

This is a Java app I designed in a few days
It is my own version of a star and constellation app such as Stellarium
The functionality is pretty straight forward: 
- slect a category from the menu on the left
- read description of the constellation
- select a star on the image to read more about it

Info about what I used:
- Java
- SQL Lite DB
- NetBeans editor

Issues and Unfinished things:

- Each constellation has two or three stars maximum. I didn't have time to write information about all the stars
- If you select a star, you have to select a new category and go back to the initial category if you want to read the category description again
- The JAR file and DB file must be together in order for the project to be run
